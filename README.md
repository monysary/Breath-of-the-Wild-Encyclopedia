## Description
In celebration of the new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom release in May 2023, I've created this online encyclopedia as a way for LoZ fans to view BOTW in-game materials and items with UI inspired by the BOTW in-game item menu. The encyclopedia features the following information from the game:
- Equipments
- Materials
- Treasures
- Creatures
- Monsters

## Usage
Users can navigate between each in-game category by selecting the left and right double arrow icons on the header. The first item on the list will be automatically selected and have its detailed information populated. Selecting item icons in the left hand side (bottom side for mobile view) will populate that item's detailed information.

## Technology
This web app was built using React and some components from the Material UI library. Data for the encyclopedia was obtained from the Hyrule Compendium API.
